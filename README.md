## Introduction

YZU LINE BOT is an interactive LINE Bot designed to streamline and simplify access to essential university-related information and tasks for both students and professors. It also serves as an alternative to the YZU APP or in some cases, even the YZU Portal. Through LINE, this bot provides a  way to quickly and easily access your Portal info, reducing the need to navigate complex university web portals directly.

You simply login through the LINE BOT and ask away whatever questions you have about your Portal data. The core of this project can be divided into three parts; The LineBot, Scraper, Database and LLM. All these parts are essential for the bot to work properly and as intended.
